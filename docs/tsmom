Time Series Momentum (TSMOM)
==============================


What is TSMOM?
---------------


Time Series Momentum, or TSMOM, is a market anomaly that captures strong positive
predictability from a security's own past returns. That is, if the past returns
are positive, they will continue to be positive and vice versa [#]_.

This is related to, however, different from "momentum" in finance literature,
which refers to the cross-sectional performance comparison of a security from
its peers, where securities that have out performed their peers in the past
three to twelve months, will continue to do so on an average. TSMOM, focuses
primarily on the security's own returns
