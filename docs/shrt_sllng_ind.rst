Short Selling in India
========================

According to `NSE <https://www.nseindia.com/products/content/equities/slbs/slbs.html>`_ `Short Selling means selling of a stock that
the seller does not own at the time of trade. Short selling can be done by borrowing the stock through Clearing Corporation/Clearing
House of a stock exchange which is registered as Approved Intermediaries (AIs). Short selling can be done by retail as well as
institutional investors. The Securities Lending and Borrowing mechanism allows short sellers to borrow securities for making delivery.`

Short Selling intraday has not limits, provided the investor covers (buys) his/her position the same day, i.e. Intraday Trading.


The National Securities Clearing Corporation Ltd. as an Approved Intermediary launched the Securities Lending  & Borrowing Scheme (SLBS)
on April 21, 2008. This scheme is facilitated on an automated screen based platform where the order matching is o price time priority and
where the participant need to quote the lending fee per share on the order matching platform. [#]_

- The Tenure of borrowing and lending is available up to a period of 12 months
