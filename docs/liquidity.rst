Liquidity Risk and Transaction Cost
====================================

To execute trading of portfolio, constituents of which are Small Cap stocks, requires understanding of the Liquidity Risk and Transaction Cost associated with each
constituents of the portfolio. Investors should not underestimate the indirect costs associated with liquidity and the the Bid/Ask Spread. In times of low liquidity,
many investors rely on the dealers, or market markers for the provision of liquidity. [#]_ Bondarenko (2001), decomposes the Bid/Ask Spread into two components, Adverse Selection
& Imperfect Competition, in which he argues that market makers post prices that are steeper than efficient prices, which then becomes the source of their profit.




`Bid/Ask <http://www.nasdaq.com/investing/glossary/b/bid-asked-spread>`_ Spread is the difference between the highest price (`Ask <http://www.nasdaq.com/investing/glossary/a/ask>`_) and investor is willing to sell its securities and the lowest price (`Bid <http://www.nasdaq.com/investing/glossary/b/bid-price>`_) at which the
investor is willing to buy its securities. One of the determinants for this Spread is the Volume of shares traded. Intuitively, it makes sense. Consider an example
when the market has less number of shares of a Security "A". This Security A is considered illiquid, which implies, lesser people trading the security at a particular
point in time. Because it is more difficult for the market maker to convert this Security A to cash, the broker needs to compensated more, thus adding to the Bid/Ask
Spread and Transaction Cost.

It is thus safe to say that market efficiency and quality could be estimated by means of how narrow the Bid/Ask Spreads are. There has
been no dearth of literature on measuring the efficiency and quality of markets through the Bid/Ask Spreads. In fact overreaction and under reaction in markets, both of which are
market inefficiencies, have often widened the Spreads in markets. [#]_ This implies that using Bid/Ask Spreads to estimate the efficiency is indeed


Let's go back to the example of Security A. Let's say that the current Bid price is $5 and the current Ask price is $5.5, the the Bid/Ask Spread of Security A is  approximately
0.9% of the current Ask price. The implication of this spread is that the investor loses 0.9% (1%) of the value of Security A as soon as he/she buys (short sells) the Security.


To study how the Transaction Cost behaves with respect to Volume we studied the average Bid-Ask Spread as the percentage of the Average Mid-Price
Intraday of present 500 constituents of NIFTY500.

'In the Figure above, we notice that the average Bid/Ask Spread as a percentage of the Mid-Price (average intraday) of NIFTY500 constituents is a decreasing function of Volume, implying
that higher trading volume comes with tighter spreads and better quality in Market Microstructure.'


Another important determinant of Bid/Ask Spread is volatility. Many studies (Chordia, Roll, and Subhramanyam, 2000, 2001, 2002) [#]_ find that higher liquidity is generally
associated with lower volatility and Transaction Cost [#]_. This makes sense intuitively, as volatility usually increases during a rapid decline or advancement of market,
in which case market makers step in to take advantage of - and profit from - the change. As the price of a security advance increasingly, more investors are willing to pay a higher
price for the security enabling the market maker to charge a higher (premium) than efficient price on the security.
