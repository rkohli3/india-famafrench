In the figure above, on the **left** is the portfolio of the current 500 stocks of `NIFTY 500 <https://www.nseindia.com/products/content/equities/indices/nifty_500.htm>`_
and on the **right** we take the constituents of the NIFTY 500 index to have ever existed. This leads us to believe that survivorship bias does indeed inflate results.

* **Delisting reasons for further forecast**

  We find the information to further forecast the credit rating of a company and use machine
  learning algorithm to forecast companies that are susceptible to failing by region.


* **Consolidating missing data for Suspension, Delisting, Merger etc.**

  Further, we consolidate our data for dates when the Stock got delisted, suspended or was off
  the exchange for any other reason, with the dates for which the data for the same stocks is unavailable.

* **Replicate for BSE**

  Once we perform the above research for `National Stock Exchange <https://www.nseindia.com>`_ we conduct the same research for `Bombay Stock Exchange. <http://www.bseindia.com/>`_

  It is interesting to see the from the period 2003-2006, both NSE and BSE saw a sharp decline of listed companies albiet delisting of companies
  The reasons for delisting are already mentioned, however, in 2004, 913 companies were delisted out of which 876 were compulsory delistings
  use to non compliance of Securities and Exchange Board of India's (`SEBI <http://www.sebi.gov.in/>`_) Guidelines.
