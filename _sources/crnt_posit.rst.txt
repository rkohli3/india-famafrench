Current Positions
===================

The links below will redirect you to our Current holding of our two hypothetical portfolio, Long Fama French Factor replicating
portfolio and Short Fama French Factor replicating portfolio, both of which have an Initial Capital of Rs. 25 Million. The allocation
to different Factors, namely **HML**, **SMB** and **WML** has been done in the ratio of 2:2:1, thus allocating Rs. 10 Million to
each **HML** and **SMB** whereas allocating Rs. 5 Million to **WML**.


The positions are as of the end of September when we rebalance our portfolio. Please note, however, the most recent sorting, which
was done on 2017-06-30, includes stocks which are now merged, suspended or delisted and thus have been left blank in the tables.
Also, due to missing Book-to-Market data for some stocks, the two-way sorting in SMB includes less number of small stocks than big stocks.
