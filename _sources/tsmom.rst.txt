Time Series Momentum (TSMOM)
==============================


What is TSMOM?
---------------


Time Series Momentum, or TSMOM, is a market anomaly that captures strong positive
predictability from a security's own past returns. That is, if the past returns
are positive, they will continue to be positive and vice versa [#]_.

This is related to, however, different from "momentum" in finance literature,
which refers to the cross-sectional performance comparison of a security from
its peers, where securities that have out performed their peers in the past
three to twelve months, will continue to do so on an average. TSMOM, focuses
primarily on the security's own returns

Moskowitz, Ooi and Pedersen (2011) have already documented the returns of more than 60
continuous futures contracts in Equity Indexes, Commodities, FX and Fixed Income.
This data is provided in their paper referenced below. However, we follow a similar methodology
to document our returns for the most liquid ETFs in the US markets and equities in
the Indian Markets chosen from NSE 500 index.

strategies within different products in different markets.
